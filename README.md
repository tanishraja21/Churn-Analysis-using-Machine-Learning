This repository presents an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis of a telecom customer churn dataset. Through rigorous analysis, the project identifies the key characteristics of customers who are more likely to churn. The project also employs several Machine Learning Classification Models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not based on a variety of parameters. With its thorough approach and detailed findings, this project offers valuable insights into customer behavior and churn prediction in the telecom industry.
